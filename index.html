		This list is very much a work in progress. In addition to adding/completing more retailers,
		the following todos are on my future wishlist:
		<ul>
		  <li>expandable rows with more information (e.g. comments)</li>
		  <li>price ranges (plastic 7-die set), or more benchmarks (HD standard, Udixi standard)</li>
		  <li>summaries: lowest benchmark, lowest free shipping threshold, brand count</li>
		  <li>commentary: favorites</li>
		  <li>sticky thead</li>
		  <li>filter by country, brand; best-for summaries (dice ids, prices, selection)</li>
		</ul>

They let you browse by manufacturer, and they list dice by the manufacturer’s name and SKU. They sell many sets as singles in any sidedness, so I'll be using that to pick up a bunch of cool d8s most likely. (Nobody sells individual d8s! So many character abilities are d8-based but it's so hard to find just d8s in cool colors!) Also, I love their random 10-dice grab bags; you usually get at least a couple interesting things. Their newsletter is probably worth your time—no spam, just new product announcements and coupon codes every month or two."

If you feel like scrolling through three pages of All The Dice They Have then this is the place for you. Maybe you’d better just sign up for their stupid expensive Mystery Set or Subscription Box and trust them to decide for you. Or maybe you’d like to spend $14 on a set of HD Dice Ancients that you can get literally anywhere else for under $10. They do have some originals, but good luck figuring out which ones they are. I don’t know if you picked up on this, but I’ve never actually bought anything from here. OKAY I have one final gripe! It is that they fall victim to one of the, in my book, cardinal sins, namely: they have a range of dice called Dragon Dice which have nothing whatsoever to do with dragons. Seriously, when Die Hard Dice is offering their scaled Drakona sets and I have seen not one but THREE Kickstarters for metal dice with actual dragons on them? I have to laugh. Not to show my Dutch Midwesterner, but oh they're in California that explains so much."

However, their non-gemstone selection is actually pretty good and well curated, and they have some plastic originals that are pretty fun. (The unicorn dice are their exclusive design, I think.) They also offer real filtering on their selection, not just dropdown menus! But, seriously, I can’t stand their gemstone sets."
